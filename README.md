# costs_of_patronage
This is a replication study of Guo, X. 2018: The Costs of Patronage: Evidence from the British Empire, published in American Economic Review, 108(11), p. 3170 - 3198

The data set used in the analysis is "analysis.dta". The final output of the replication (results and text) can be found in "replication_chmielowski.pdf". The tables in this document are produced in "01_tables.R" and saved in the "results" folder, the plots come from "02_figures.R" and are saved in the "figure" folder. The Rnw-document "replication_chmielowski.Rnw" sources from these folders to create the final pdf document. If you run "00_master.R" it should calculate and compile everything from scratch. It may take a couple of minutes.
